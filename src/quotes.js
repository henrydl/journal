export var productivity = ['Astronauts work and sleep on fixed schedules to match a 24-hour daily cycle, and circadian rhythms.','After eating, Astronauts settle down to the assigned tasks of the day, either supervising experiments or performing routine maintenance on station equipment.','"I think it will be a good idea to have an active mindset such as \'I am refraining from going out and choosing to stay home to protect the lives of my loved ones\' or thinking how to enjoy the time you have." - Atsuhiro Mitsumaru, principal medical officer of the Human Spaceflight Technology Directorate at JAXA.','Astronauts aboard the ISS are encouraged to keep a journal to help combat the effects of isolation. Journals give a safe place to vent frustrations and give researchers a tool to study behavioral issues and other things that are on the minds of crew members who are living and working in isolation and confinement.'];
 
export var eating = ['Space meals are prepared and eaten under the same basic restrictions: food and drink has to be somehow confined, or else it will wander off around the station. ','Drinks and soups are served in plastic bags and sipped with straws.','Astronauts can eat solid dishes with a knife and fork, which are kept safely from wandering off via magnets on the dining table.','Prolonged microgravity dulls taste buds, so spicy food is usually an ISS crew favorite.'];
 
export var exercise = ['A less stressful daily routine involves exercise. The human body loses muscle and bone in weightlessness; a few hours of daily exercise helps to keep some tone in muscles that would otherwise see little use. ','Exercise helps relieve the so-called \'space snuffles\', caused when body fluids, no longer tugged downward by gravity, accumulate in the head.','ISS has a treadmill; it also has an exercise bike. Astronauts have to strap themselves down to the exercise machines, of course: unrestrained, their own efforts would make them float away.','"It depends on the crew, but exercising is important not only for staying fit physically but also for decreasing psychological stress."  - JAXA astronaut Koichi Wakata'];
 
export var sleep = ['Astronauts are Woken up by an alarm each morning.','Airflow is required in an astronautâ€™s sleeping spot because of the danger of oxygen starvation from a carbon dioxide bubble forming around a sleeping person.','During space missions, roughly three quarters of shuttle and ISS crew members reported taking sleep-promoting medication.','Shuttle crew members reported taking sleep-promoting medications on about half of their nights in space, including nights prior to performing extra vehicular activity (EVA) work the next day which were extra mentally and physically demanding.'];
 
export var leisure = ['The crew on the ISS will normally have some free time before bed. These hours are precious: this is when they might write emails home, watch DVDs, or transmit just for fun on ham radio. People on Earth can do these things too, of course. But ground dwellers cannot hope to share the most popular leisure pursuit in space: just watching the Earth turning below. Astronauts swear that the view is never dull.','Like most people who work full time, astronauts get weekends off. On any given day, ISS crew members can watch movies, play music, read books, play cards and talk to their families.','The space station crews can ask mission control to send them shows that they can watch during dinner or off-duty time.','During missions, astronauts are very busy. The few hours of free time may also be spent looking out the window at the beautiful Earth below, listening to music, surfing the web, or corresponding with friends and family back home.','Having a variety of tasks, experiments, meals, and change of crewmembers prevented Akihiko Hoshide, a JAXA astronaut, from getting bored while staying on the ISS for long periods.'];

Now, they can send email to friends and family directly, and make phone calls using a hook-up through their computers.','The phone connection is really clear from the ISS. ','Many astronauts carry pictures of their family with them on space missions.','"My concern under this stay-at-home request is the situation of the elderly living alone. Other than using messaging apps and video calls, writing letters may also be a good idea to stay in touch." - Atsuhiro Mitsumaru, principal medical officer of the Human Spaceflight Technology Directorate at JAXA','Special occasions could play a role in boosting mental wellbeing. - JAXA astronaut Koichi Wakata','"People feel differently about things such as tidiness, noise, and smell.

export var misc = ['Astronauts aboard the ISS experience 15 sunrises per day.','There is no shower on the ISS. Astronauts wash with wet towels. Astronauts wash their hair with a \'rinseless\' shampoo that was originally developed for hospital patients who were unable to take a shower.','Daily, each human breathes the equivalent of 0.9 kg of liquid oxygen - enough air to fill a 3.5 cubic metre room - and drinks a total of 2.7 kg of water.','Waste water from urine and moisture condensed from the air is either purified and reused directly, or broken down by electrolysis to provide fresh oxygen. Carbon dioxide \'scrubbers\' chemically remove that toxic gas from the air.','One substance that is not recycled on ISS is solid human waste: it is collected, compressed and stored for disposal. The space toilet that does the collecting has a somewhat intimidating appearance. But it is a huge improvement on the sanitary arrangements that earlier astronauts had to endure.
